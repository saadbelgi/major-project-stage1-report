Tropical cyclones pose significant threats to coastal regions, including the Indian Subcontinent, often resulting in substantial economic losses and profound impacts on communities. Accurately estimating and forecasting cyclone intensity, measured by maximum sustained wind speeds and central pressure, is critical for disaster relief agencies to plan effective evacuation and relocation efforts, ultimately saving lives and minimizing property damage. Satellite imagery provides vital data on a storm's structure, cloud patterns, eye structure, convective activity and evolution over time, and can be utilized for real time intensity estimation. Our project presents a deep learning based solution for this task, utilizing deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract meaningful information from satellite images. We have used a dataset consisting of more than 30,000 images (184 cyclones) to train and compare performances of ResNet-18, ResNet-34 and Resnet-50 architectures for regression of central pressure of the cyclone. Furthermore, we have experimented with Inception architecture with and without residual connections, as well as aforementioned models for the task of intensity grade classification. We plan to utilize sequential information for forecasting and develop a real-time forecasting module in the next stage of our project.
