It is really a pleasure to acknowledge the help and support that has gone to in mak-
ing this Major Project. We express our sincere gratitude to our guide Prof.\ Jignesh Sisodia for his invaluable guidance. We thank him for encouraging us to work
on  ``Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation and Forecasting using Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning'' project. We were admitted through Com-
puter Science and Engineering Data Science branch and without his encouragement
this work would not be a reality. With the freedom she provided, we really enjoyed working under him.\par
We thank our internal examinor and expert, Dr.\ Kailas Devadkar for his feedback and word of advice on
our project helping us see the big picture.\par
We thank our HOD and staff of Computer Science and Engineering Department
for giving us all the facilities required to carry out this project.\par
We would like to thank our family members and well wishers for their constant
encouragement for all these years, without which we could not have completed this
work.
